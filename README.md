Love Calculator
This Love Calculator is a simple Python script that calculates the compatibility score between two people based on their names.

How It Works
The script prompts the user to enter their name and their partner's name.
It combines both names into one string and converts it to lowercase.
It counts the occurrences of the letters 'T', 'R', 'U', 'E' for the first digit of the score.
It counts the occurrences of the letters 'L', 'O', 'V', 'E' for the second digit of the score.
It combines the two digits to form the final score.
The script then evaluates the score to provide a fun message about the compatibility.

Messages
Score < 10 or > 90: "Your score is {score}, you go together like coke and mentos."
Score between 40 and 50: "Your score is {score}, you are alright together."
Any other score: "Your score is {score}."
Running the Script
To run the script, simply execute it in a Python environment. It will prompt for input and display the results based on the provided names.
